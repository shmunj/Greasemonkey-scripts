# Greasemonkey-scripts
Some of my Greasemonkey scripts.

In order to use them, you need to have [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) add-on for Mozilla Firefox installed. When you do, you can download the script you want (including the files it depends on, of course) from one of these directories and open the main script file (it ends with ".user.js") in your web browser. The Greasemonkey will ask for your confirmation after which the script will be installed and ready for use.
