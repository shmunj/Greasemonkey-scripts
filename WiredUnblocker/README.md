# Wired Unblocker
Very simple script that removes the "veil" element and restores scrolling on wired.com when the site detects you are using an ad blocker.

I don't mind supporting some websites by enabling ads, but I find obscuring content in this way annoying, so I'd rather just remove the element that hides the article.
