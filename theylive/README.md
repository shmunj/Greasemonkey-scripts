#THEY LIVE
"I'm giving you a choice: either put on these glasses or start eatin' that trash can."

This script fixes a new element in the bottom-left corner of the page. You can click on the arrow and put on or take off the glasses from John Carpenter's awesome movie [They Live](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096256/). They let you see subliminal messages our alien overlords are projecting from the hidden reality.

The script replaces "src" attribute of all "img" elements with random message seen in ads on bilboards, newspapers, money, etc in the movie. It keeps dimensions of original images, and original source is perserved in "data-oldsrc" attribute that is given to the element so you can always see the original images.

Until I add a listener for new AJAX calls, you'll have to click on the glasses icon to "direct your vision" to images added after you put your glasses on (or you can take them off and put them on again).
